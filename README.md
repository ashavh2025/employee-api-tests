## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run Locally

1. **Install Node.js** (if not installed):  
   [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

2. **Install Newman and HTML Reporter:**  
   ```bash
   npm install -g newman newman-reporter-htmlextra
   ```

3. **Run the Postman Collection:**  
   ```bash
   newman run Employee_Collection.postman_collection.json    -e Employee_Environment.postman_environment.json    -r cli,htmlextra    --reporter-htmlextra-export newman-report.html
   ```

4. **View HTML Report:**  
   Open `newman-report.html` in a browser to see detailed test results.

## üîÅ CI/CD Integration (GitHub Actions)

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/api-tests.yml`  
- Runs automatically on:
  - Push to `main`  
  - Pull requests  
  - Manual triggers (workflow_dispatch)  

- Generates HTML report and uploads it as an artifact for review.  

**Example Badge (add to README):**
```markdown
![API Tests](https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo-name>/actions/workflows/api-tests.yml/badge.svg)
```
> Replace `<your-username>` and `<your-repo-name>` with your GitHub info.

## üìà Optional Enhancements

- **Data-driven testing** with CSV or JSON  
- **Negative test scenarios** (invalid IDs, missing fields)  
- **Slack/Teams notifications** for test pass/fail  
- **Scheduled runs** via Postman Monitors  
- **Parallel execution** for large collections

## üó£ How to Explain in Interviews

> ‚ÄúI designed an end-to-end API automation project using Postman for CRUD operations on an Employee Management System.  
> I implemented environment variable chaining, assertions, CLI automation with Newman, HTML reporting, and CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.  
> The setup validates API functionality automatically on every commit or pull request, simulating real-world regression testing workflows.‚Äù
